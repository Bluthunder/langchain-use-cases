Here is an example of how you can generate test automation step definitions with code in JavaScript for Selenium Page Object Model:

```javascript
const { Given, When, Then } = require('cucumber');
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { HomePage } = require('../pageObjects/HomePage');
const { VideoPlayerPage } = require('../pageObjects/VideoPlayerPage');

Given('the user is on the OTT platform', async function () {
    this.homePage = new HomePage();
    await this.homePage.open();
});

When('the user selects a video to play', async function () {
    await this.homePage.selectVideo();
});

Then('the video should start playing successfully', async function () {
    const videoPlayerPage = new VideoPlayerPage();
    const isPlaying = await videoPlayerPage.isPlaying();
    expect(isPlaying).to.be.true;
});

// Repeat the above steps for the remaining scenarios

```

In this code snippet, we are using Cucumber for writing BDD-style test scenarios. We have defined step definitions for each scenario and used Page Object Model to interact with the web elements on the pages. The `HomePage` and `VideoPlayerPage` classes represent the page objects for the home page and video player page respectively. The `expect` statement from Chai is used for assertions in the test scenarios.
