# File 
To generate a page object class with all interaction methods implemented, you can create a separate file for each page object class and define the methods to interact with the web elements on that page. Here is an example of how you can create a page object class for the HomePage:

```javascript
const { By, Key } = require('selenium-webdriver');
const BasePage = require('./BasePage');

class HomePage extends BasePage {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.url = 'https://example.com/home';
    }

    async open() {
        await this.driver.get(this.url);
    }

    async selectVideo() {
        const videoElement = await this.driver.findElement(By.xpath('//div[@class="video"]'));
        await videoElement.click();
    }
}

module.exports = { HomePage };
```

In this code snippet, we have created a `HomePage` class that extends a `BasePage` class. The `open()` method navigates to the URL of the home page, and the `selectVideo()` method interacts with the video element on the page by clicking on it.

You can follow a similar approach to create a page object class for the `VideoPlayerPage` as well. By organizing your code in this way, you can easily maintain and reuse the interaction methods for different pages in your test automation framework.
