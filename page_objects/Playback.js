Here is an example of how the OTTPlaybackPage page object class can be implemented with all interaction methods:

```javascript
const { By, Key, until } = require('selenium-webdriver');
const driver = require('../driver'); // Assuming you have a driver setup

class OTTPlaybackPage {
    static async selectVideo() {
        // Add code to select a video to play
    }

    static async isVideoPlaying() {
        // Add code to check if the video is playing
    }

    static async pauseVideo() {
        // Add code to pause the video
    }

    static async resumeVideo() {
        // Add code to resume the video
    }

    static async skipForward() {
        // Add code to skip forward in the video
    }

    // Add any other interaction methods as needed

}

module.exports = OTTPlaybackPage;
```

In this class, you can implement the interaction methods for selecting a video, checking if the video is playing, pausing/resuming the video, skipping forward, and any other interactions you may need for the OTT playback page. Make sure to replace the placeholder comments with the actual code to perform the respective actions.
